        <h2>Hello, my name is Brandon Jackson.</h2>
        <p>Hello, welcome to my page. In 2018 revceived my Bachelors degree in Public history at Western Michigan University. 
        During my undergrad I studied abroad in Cape Town South Africa for seven months. 
        After commpleteing an academic semester at the University of Cape Town,
        I did an Internship at Robben Island Musuem, where I conducted research on how Robben Island was utilized for coastal defense during WWII. 
        When I retuned home I also interned aboard the USS Lexington Musuem in Corpus Christie Texas,  as an assitant curator. 
        Today I currently attend the University of Michigan School of Infromation in Ann Arbor Michigan. I am in the MSI program studying Digital Curation. 
        My dream is to become a data curator.</p>
